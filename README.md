# Book-Search

This Book search is intended to create a search and save function for individuals looking to save a wishlist of future book reading.

## Description
This website was created with my knowledge of Mongo DB/Apollo, Mongoose, and graphql. Using the starter code given by the bootcamp, I refractored a working resful API application and converted it to Graphql using Apollo server. The application was built using a MERN stack with a REACT front end and a MongoDB back end.

## Usage
This website was created so a user could log-in to then search and save books they are interested in. The application uses auth to selectively provide features only when the user is logged in. 

## Conclusion
Durning my creation of this webpage I have learned and sharpened many of my coding skills. These skills include:

* Re-familiarized myself with mongoose and MongoDB.

* Furthered my knowledge of React components, links, and flow

* I gained a better understanding of Apollo

* Gained knoledge of graphql functionality

* Learned useful ways to implement jw token and authentication

* Achvieved a working knowledge of MERN structure
